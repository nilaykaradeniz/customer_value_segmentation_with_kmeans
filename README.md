# Customer Value Segmentation with Kmeans Algorithm

Various metrics such as when the customers last traded, how often they traded, how much money they left, how many different months they traded will be looked at, and the kmeas clustering algorithm, which is one of the statistical methods, will be used.

With this clustering method, customers will be divided into clusters to form a homogeneous structure within themselves. The value of the customer clusters found with the lift calculation will be determined. Thus, the customer value will be determined.
